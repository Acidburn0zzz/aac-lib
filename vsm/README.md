## vsm
Linux Version of VMware Software Manager

### Description
A Linux and slightly more intelligent version of VSM for Linux. It ignores
missing definition files that cause the VMware version to stop working. It
also finds ones not in the definitions yet. It is also possible to find
the latest of every package.

This version was optimized for RedHat style distributions and will need
a change to work on non-RedHat style distributions. If someone uses
debian and wants this to work there, get me the dpkg commands needed.

To install use the following script (it will prompt you for the root
password) no need to use sudo yourself:

```
#!/bin/sh
which wget >& /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 1 ]
then
	sudo yum -y install wget
fi

wget -O aac-base.install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Texiwill/aac-lib/master/base/aac-base.install
chmod +x aac-base.install
./aac-base.install -u
sudo ./aac-base.install -i vsm
```

Here is an example run and help:
```
$ /usr/local/bin/vsm.sh --help
/usr/local/bin/vsm.sh [--dlg search] [-d|--dryrun] [-f|--force] [--favorite] 
[-e|--exit] [-h|--help] [-l|--latest] [-m|--myvmware] [-mr] [-ns|--nostore] 
[-nc|--nocolor] [--dts|--nodts] [--oem|--nooem] [--oss|--nooss] [-p|--password

    --dlg - download specific package by name or part of a name
    -d|--dryrun - dryrun, do not download
    -f|--force - force download of packages
    --favorite - Download suite marked as favorite, works with -m/-mr option
    -e|--exit - reset and exit
    -h|--help - this help
    -l|--latest - substitute latest for each package instead of listed
    	Only really useful for latest distribution at moment
	Not as useful as it once was.
    -m|--myvmware - get missing suite and packages from My VMware
    -mr - reset just My VMware information, implies -m
    -ns|--nostore - do not store credential data and remove if exists
    -nc|--nocolor - do not output with color
    -p|--password - specify password
    --progress - show progress of downloads (only makes sense with -q)

	useful
    -u|--username - specify username
    -v|--vsmdir path - set VSM directory
                       saved to configuration file
    -V|--version - version number
    -y - do not ask to continue
    --dts - include DriversTools in All-style downloads
            saved to configuration file
    --nodts - do not include DriversTools in All-style downloads
              saved to configuration file
    --oss - include OpenSource in All-style downloads
            saved to configuration file
    --nooss - do not include OpenSource in All-style downloads
              saved to configuration file
    --oem - include CustomIso in All-style downloads
            saved to configuration file
    --nooem - do not include CustomIso in All-style downloads
              saved to configuration file
    --debug - debug mode
    --repo path - specify path of repo
                  saved to configuration file
    --save - save defaults to $HOME/.vsmrc

	All-style downloads include: All, All_No_OpenSource, Minimum_Required
	Requires packages:
	wget python python-urllib3 libxml2 perl-XML-Twig ncurses

	To Download the latest Perl CLI use (to escape the wild cards):
	./vsm.sh --dlg CLI\.\*\\.x86_64.tar.gz

       Use of the Mark option, marks the current product suite as the
       favorite. There is only 1 favorite slot available. Favorites
       can be downloaded without traversing the menus.

       Those items that show up in Cyan when the -m|--myvmware option
       is set are those items only seen with that option. I.e. not part
       of the standard downloads from VSM. 

       Those items in reverse color (white on black or cyan) are those items
       not downloaded. For packages and not files, the reverse color only
       shows up if the directory is not in the repo and is not related to 
       missing files or new files.

       To enable download of My VMware content which includes minimally
       VMware Horizon, VMware Horizon Clients, VMware Workstation,
       and VMware Fusion use the -m option. Else they will not appear.

       Caveat: Access to these downloads does not imply you are licensed
       for the material. Please see My VMware for your licenses.

### Installation
Place in any directory. Requires the following packages:
	wget python python-urllib3 libxml2 perl-XML-Twig ncurses

### Update
To keep vsm and your repository updated to the latest release/downloads
you can add the following lines to your local cron. This tells the
system to update the installer, then update vsm, then run vsm with your
currently marked favorite. Note 'user' is your username. 

Caveat: This approach only works if you use the aac-lib/base installers to
install vsm. If you did not then just use the last line.

Be sure to mark a release as your favorite! If you do not, this does
not work. The 'Mark' menu item does this.

I added these lines to a script within /etc/cron.daily (which usually runs at 3AM):
```
cd /home/user
/home/user/aac-base.install -u
/home/user/aac-base.install -i vsm
```

The following line starts VSM download at 6AM. You would add using the command `crontab -e`:
```
0 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/vsm.sh -y -mr --favorite
```

### Support
Email elh at astroarch dot com for assistance or if you want to add
for more items.

If someone can provide debian package maangement bits, send them on as
that is the only distribution specific bits in the script.

### Changelog
3.7.8 - Bug fix when missing .vsmrc, fixes to progress. My thanks to Alex
Lopez (@ivirtualex) for finding the bug.

3.7.7 - slight change to versioning of a package

3.7.6 - Changes to how .vsmrc is processed to support Docker. .vsmrc can 
now be in $HOME, Repo Dir, or VSM XML Dir (/tmp/vsm). If the .vsmrc is
in any directory besides the default or $HOME you will need to specify
the --repo or -v|--vsmdir options and order is important.

3.7.5 - Fix to progress bars once more, should be final form. Added another
suite and fixed more broken due to new version downloads.
