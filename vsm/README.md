## vsm
Linux Version of VMware Software Manager

### Description
A slightly more intelligent version of VSM for Linux and MacOS. It ignores
missing definition files that cause the VMware version to stop working. It
also finds packages not in the definitions yet. It is also possible to find
the latest of every package.

As of v4.0.0 LinuxVSM now uses the My VMware mode by default. This
implies that previously out of date items are now up to date once more.

Also, you should know that Code Stream is a license ontop of VRA, and
VRA is already in LinuxVSM.

To install on MacOS X read <a href=https://github.com/Texiwill/aac-lib/blob/master/vsm/MacOS.md>MacOS.md</a>.

To install on Linux use the included script, install.sh as follows.
```
	chmod 755 install.sh
	./install.sh
```
If you are outside the America/Chicago timezone you will want to call it as follows:
```
	./install.sh Time/Zone
```

For example to set the time zone for London UK use:
```
	./install.sh 'Europe/London'
```

For example to automatically pick up the time zone use:
```
	./install.sh `timedatectl status | grep "zone" | sed -e 's/^[ ]*Time zone: \(.*\) (.*)$/\1/g'`
```

Here is an example run and help:

    Requires packages:

	$ vsm.sh -mr -y --dlg CLI\.\*\\.x86_64.tar.gz

    Use of the Mark option, marks the current product suite as the
    favorite. There is only 1 favorite slot available. Favorites
    can be downloaded without traversing the menus. To download your 
    favorite use:
	$ vsm.sh -mr -y --favorite -q --progress

    Those items that show up in Cyan are those where My VMware meta data has    
    not been downloaded yet.

    Those items in reverse color (white on black or cyan) are those items
    not downloaded. For packages and not files, the reverse color only
    shows up if the directory is not in the repo and is not related to 
    missing files or new files.

    Caveat: Access to these downloads does not imply you are licensed
    for the material. Please see My VMware for your licenses.

Example Run:

$ vsm.sh -mr -y -c

	Version:	4.5.0
	Data Version:   1.0.0

### Installation
To install use the provided install.sh script which calls the aac-lib/base installers to install vsm.

### Update
To keep vsm and your repository updated to the latest release/downloads
you can add the following lines to your local cron. This tells the
system to update the installer, then update vsm, then run vsm with your
currently marked favorite. Note 'user' is your username. 

Caveat: This approach only works if you use the aac-lib/base installers to
install vsm. If you did not then just use the last line.

Be sure to Mark a release as your favorite! If you do not, this does
not work. The 'Mark' menu item does this.

Do the following to auto-update LinuxVSM every day at 3AM (Note: update.sh
is only created if you use install.sh to install, inspect the shell
script for the appropriate lines for your own update.sh)
```
cp $HOME/aac-base/update.sh /etc/cron.daily
```

The following line starts VSM download at 6AM. You would add using the
command `crontab -e`:
```
0 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/vsm.sh -c -y -mr --favorite
```

The following line starts VSM download at 6AM for multiple favorites. You
would add using the command `crontab -e`:
```
0 6 * * * ~/bin/vsm_favorites.sh
```

Where vsm_favorites.sh is taken from the tools directory herein. Please
modify for your favorites.

### Use Case/Examples
See the tools directory and its README.md to see all examples of using
LinuxVSM in scripts

#### Frequently Asked Questions
* I receive a "Credential Error Getting" error

This has three solutions, one is not solvable except by VMware. 

1. If your My VMware account has not been used recently or has no entitlements or trials, it is possible that your VMware Software Manager entitlement has been removed or is not working. You can verify this by using the VMware provided VMware Software Manager on a Windows system and attempt to login. If that works, then it is one of the other issues.

2. If your DNS server is acting up, you may get Credential errors, check that DNS is working.

3. Your credential may be incorrect. Remove your "VSM XML Dir", usually /tmp/vsm (rm /tmp/vsm)  and start over.

* I receive a "Network Error Getting" error

This is usually a sign that DNS is not working or the site is
unavailable. Verify you can reach https://my.vmware.com to verify the
site and DNS. Occassionally VMware does maintenance that causes issues. Or
the DNS server you are working is not working correctly.
