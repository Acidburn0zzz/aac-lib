## vsm
Linux Version of VMware Software Manager (MacOS Install)
- <a href=https://github.com/Texiwill/aac-lib/tree/master/>List of Tools</a>

### Description
A MacOS and slightly more intelligent version of VSM. See README.md for more information:
- <a href=https://github.com/Texiwill/aac-lib/tree/master/vsm>LinuxVSM README</a>

### Installation
Tested against MacOS X High Sierra - 10.13.4

To install vsm.sh on MacOS you need to first install the prerequisites. 
Those are Xcode, XML::Twig, Homebrew, jq, and wget. Here is how you do those:

	First install Xcode from Apple
	Next install Homebrew using:
		$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	Next install gnu-sed, jq, and wget
		brew install gnu-sed
		brew install wget
		brew install jq
	Next install XML::Twig (note the 'sudo'), if you rather not use sudo,
	and I can understand why, you will have to update your PATH variables
	to also point to where the xml_grep command is located. This is 
	accomplished by editting /etc/paths. It is usually installed somewhere 
	within your home directory so 'find $HOME -name xml_grep -print' can 
	find it for you.
		sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
		cpan> install XML::Twig
		... lots of questions and such. Answer YES or Y or y to
		any yes/no question presented ...
		cpan> exit
	Next install vsm.sh (note the use of 'sudo')
		sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/vsm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Texiwill/aac-lib/master/vsm/vsm.sh
		sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vsm.sh

### Update
To keep vsm and your repository updated to the latest release/downloads
you can add the following lines to your local cron. This tells the
system to update the installer, then update vsm, then run vsm with your
currently marked favorite. Note 'user' is your username. 

Be sure to Mark a release as your favorite! If you do not, this does
not work. The 'Mark' menu item does this.

I added these lines to a script within /etc/cron.daily (which usually
runs at 3AM):
```
wget -O /usr/local/bin/vsm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Texiwill/aac-lib/master/vsm/vsm.sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vsm.sh
```

The following line starts VSM download at 6AM. You would add using the
command `crontab -e`:
```
0 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/vsm.sh -y -c -mr --favorite
```

Note if you do not want to use sudo, you can install vsm.sh into
any directory you desire. You will have to adjust the paths above
appropriately.
