## vsm vExpert
Linux Version of VMware Software Manager (vExpert Usage)

### Notes

VMware vExperts now have a tool they can use to download their entitled
packages in full. To do so, you need two logins:
	- My VMware
	- vExpert Portal

And a new option: --vexpertx

With these two logins and the appropriate flag certain files will be
made available to any vExpert. Note, this is not all files. These files
are also updated weekly instead of daily. It may also take longer to
update with full releases versus older releases. I would count on N and
N-1 versions being available. However, this is subject to change as well.

How does LinuxVSM handle vExperts? By adding the correct flag, you will
then be prompted to put in your vExpert Portal username and password
and if saved (do not worry they are encrypted on disk) you can reuse
the tool as many times as you want. However a --clean will remove those
files as well as anything else temporary.

The vExpert bits work by first checking for correct login for the vExpert
Portal and if it finds a unentitled file in My VMware fill that in with
an available vExpert Portal file it finds. So in essence, it goes to My
VMware first then to the vExpert Portal in a seamless fashion. When
you run LinuxVSM I strongly suggest using the -mr option to ensure your
temporary files are refreshed every run, else your available files will
be out of date.

The vExpert Portal itself uses LinuxVSM to create the directory structure
presented so it is as complete as My VMware. The vExpert Portal does
not store the Drivers Tools section as you can get that from My VMware,
but does store the rest.
