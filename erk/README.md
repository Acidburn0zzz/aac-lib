## ERK (Elasticsearch-Rsyslog-Kibana) Stack Installer

### Description
A bash script to automatically install an Elasticsearch-Rsyslog-Kibana
stack. Rsyslog replaces Logstash and allows direct forwarding of syslog
messages to Elasticsearch for other processing. I forward my LogInsight
logs to ERK for use with ElasticSearch.

Why did I create this script? Nothing I found on the web was as automated,
pulled the latest sources, and worked seamlessly with rsyslog.

### Installation
Run the script using SUDO as root access is required. This allows Kibana to be wide open on your network. So first thing is to ensure proper firewall settings to limit access.

If the files exist, currently just erk.install.nginx, it takes the erk.install.filename as a possible way to secure Kibana/ES. So, we currently have a way to frontend ERK with an Nginx proxy to add simple authentication.

### Todo

- Add support for ES Shield
- Add Grafana support
- Determine why TCP 514 cannot receive syslog messages
- Determine why we have to start rsyslog outside of systemctl

### Support
Email elh at astroarch dot com for assistance or if you want to add
for more items.

### Changelog
- changed rsyslogd from starting w/systemctl as it does not always work
  with ES

- fixed SELinux for the Nginx frontend to Kibana

- Added initial Nginx Support
